### Description
This application uses PWA (progressive web app) to create a text edit where it will store the information enter into the text editor and store it various parts of the browsers storage, including but not limited to, session storage, manifest, service worker, and local storage.

Once cloning the application, I recommend running in the integrated terminal from the root package.json an npm install, then an npm run start.
